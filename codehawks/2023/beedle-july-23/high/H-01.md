# Fee contract executes swap without slippage protection.

## Summary - Vulnerability Details

In the `Fee` contract's `sellProfits` function, we are performing a swap of loan tokens to collateral tokens but we have set the `amountOutMinimum` equal to `0`, which means we accept the minimum tokens came out from this swap are `0`.

This is a huge vulnerabilty!

An attacker bot can listen for the swap transaction and can perform sandwich attacks (frontrunning) using flash loans.

## Impact

That will cause a loss of funds for swappers

## Code Snippet

```solidity
/// @notice swap loan tokens for collateral tokens from liquidations
/// @param _profits the token to swap for WETH
function sellProfits(address _profits) public {
    require(_profits != WETH, "not allowed");

    uint256 amount = IERC20(_profits).balanceOf(address(this));

    // * @audit high - lack of slippage protection
    ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams memory params = ISwapRouter
        .ExactInputSingleParams({
            tokenIn: _profits,
            tokenOut: WETH,
            fee: 3000,
            recipient: address(this),
            deadline: block.timestamp,
            amountIn: amount,
            amountOutMinimum: 0,
            sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0
        });

    amount = swapRouter.exactInputSingle(params);

    IERC20(WETH).transfer(staking, IERC20(WETH).balanceOf(address(this)));
}
```

## Tools Used

Manual Review

## Recommendations

Should check the prize before the swap and pass the minimum expected tokens based on it in the `sellProfits` function.
