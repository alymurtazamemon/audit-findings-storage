## Summary - Vulnerability Details

This is the known bug we learned in the tutorial but because it was not mentioned in the `know issues` due to that I am mentioning it.

The protocol gives a `10%` bonus to liquidators when they pay the users' borrowed DSC back to the protocol in order to gain their collateral. It means we are paying them `$110` in collateral tokens for `$100` DSC tokens.

It means if the collateral tokens value will be less than `$110` then the protocol will not be able to incentivize the liquidators.

It is also possible that the contract will have the collective amount for that token to pay the `10%` but this will damage the last users who redeem their collateral for that token but the contract will not have that because it pays incentives.

## Recommendations

Give the bonus only when the collateral amount is greater than `110%`, this way obviously liquidators will not gain any profit for doing liquidation but project owners can save the protocol when the collateral will be less than `110%`.
